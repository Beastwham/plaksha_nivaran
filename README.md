Hi, welcome to our website! 

We (Prashant and Stuti) are working on creating a chatbot named Nivaran as a part of our learning process at Plaksha University's Technology Leadership Programme. This website is currently being built. Here's the NABC Analysis of our project:

**Needs:**

Our client is Plaksha University. We want to position ourselves as a premier technology institution and for that, we want to showcase what our students have accomplished. We want to intrigue people who visit our website, to make them curious. On the other hand, we, like any establishment, would benefit if the workload of our employees is reduced. 

**Approach:**

We want to create a conversational chatbot named Nivaran. Nivaran means answers. Nivaran would be able to converse with visitors, help them with their queries and tell them more about Plaksha university. Nivaran would be able to take the contact details of our visitors and provide them to the admissions team at Plaksha. 
In the first iteration, Nivaran would be able to interact with users by clicking on buttons and answering questions. In our further iterations, we’ll make Nivaran more conversational and our end goal is for Nivaran to be able to converse naturally with the visitor.
Nivaran will answer most of the questions about the university and would be able to guide the visitors throughout the admissions process as well.


**Benefits:**

Let’s classify these visitors into certain buckets and then see how our chatbot would help to convert each visitor into a business lead:

•	People who are just glancing at the websites of universities. These visitors might be looking for universities for themselves or their kids but there’s not an immediate need. Such visitors aren’t interested enough to put in the effort to make a call to know more about the university. Our chatbot will make Plaksha stand out and such visitors will remember Plaksha. Not only that, our chatbot is an easily accessible tool for them to know more about the university. 

•	Graduates looking for career options or PhD programmes, kids in 12th standard, or their parents. These visitors are researching different universities and might be noting down the pros and cons of each one of them. A chatbot created by students of Plaksha that works well is a visible result of the quality education Plaksha provide, and it’ll go into the list of pros.

•	Influential individuals or investors. A chatbot definitely will assure them that they’re contributing towards a good purpose. 

•	Students/Employees of Plaksha. Instead of asking people or employees about something, we ourselves might go on the website, and interact with the chatbot and we’ll get that information easily. 

Answering queries reduces the workload of the customer support team and it’ll also get leads for the admissions team.


**Competition/Alternatives:**

An alternative is to look up the website’s FAQ section. Nivaran will provide visitors with the information they need on whatever page they are. While other chatbot service providers are available in the market, they charge exorbitant prices. We’re building Nivaran as a part of our learning journey and it is our own way of giving back to the university that has been our home for the past couple of months, to the university that graciously welcomed us and has been a source of learning and joy.
